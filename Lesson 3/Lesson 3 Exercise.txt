1. Write code in which a String variable s contains “The number of rabbits is”. An integer variable argh has a value of 129. Concatenate these variables into a String called report.
   Then print report. The printout should yield: The number of rabbits is 129. Note that we want a period to print after the 9. 

   public class tester {
   	   public static void main(String args[]){
		   String s = "The number of rabbits is";
		   int argh = 129;
		   String report = s + " " + argh + ".";
		   System.out.println(report);
	   }
   }


2. What is the output of System.out.println( p.toUpperCase( ) ); if p = “Groovy Dude”? 

   GROOVY DUDE

3. Write code that will assign the value of “Computer Science is for nerds” to the String variable g. Then have it print this String with nothing but “small” letters. 

   public class tester {
	   public static void main(String args[]){
		   String g = "Computer Science is for nerds";
		   System.out.print(g.toLowerCase());
	   }
   }

4. What will be the value of c? 
	String c;
	String m = “The Gettysburg Address”;
	c = m.substring(4); 

   The variable c will equal "Gettysburg Address".

5. What will be the value c? 
	String b = “Four score and seven years ago,”;
	String c = b.substring(7, 12); 

   The variable c will equal "ore a".

6. What is the value of count? 
	int count;
	String s = “Surface tension”;
	count = s.length(); 

   15

7. Write code that will look at the number of characters in String m = “Look here!”; and then 
print  
	“Look here!” has 10 characters. 
Use the length( ) method to print the 10 ....you must also force the two quotes to print. 

   public class tester {
 	   public static void main(String args[]){
		   String m = "Look here!";
		   int p = m.length();
		   String finalOut = "\"" + m + "\"" + " has " + p + " charecters.";
		   System.out.print(finalOut);
	   }
   }

8. How would you print the following? 
	All “good” men should come to the aid of their country.

 	   public static void main(String args[]){
		   String m = "good";
		   String finalOut = "All " + "\"" + m + "\"" + " men should come to the aid of their country.";
		   System.out.print(finalOut);
	   }
   }


9. Write code that will produce the following printout using only a single println( ).
	Hello 
	Hello again 


   public class tester {
 	   public static void main(String args[]){
		   System.out.print("Hello\nHello Again");
	   }
   }

10. Write code that will produce the following printout. 
	A backslash looks like this \, ...right? 

   public class tester {
 	   public static void main(String args[]){
		   System.out.print("A backslash looks like this \\, ...right?");
	   }
   }

11. What is output by the following? 
	String pq = “Eddie Haskel”;
	int hm = pq.length( );
